# 🎉 Quizzical

Welcome to **Quizzical**, a fun and interactive quiz app built as my final solo project for the [Scrimba React course](https://scrimba.com/)! This project showcases my ability to build a complete web application using modern tools and technologies in the React ecosystem.

## 🧠 What is Quizzical?

Quizzical is a simple quiz game that lets users test their general knowledge. It fetches trivia questions from an online database and presents them in a clean, user-friendly interface. Users can select answers, submit the quiz, and instantly see how they did.

This project was designed to demonstrate:

- My understanding of React fundamentals
- How to manage state and user interactions
- How to work with external APIs

## 🚧 How I Built It

This project was developed from the ground up as part of my final solo assignment for the Scrimba React course. While I was provided with a Figma design and a few helpful tips, all the coding and implementation were done by me.

Here’s what I worked on:

- Translating the provided design into a fully functional web app

- Connecting to a trivia API to load fresh quiz questions

- Building interactive answer blocks that highlight correct and incorrect choices when submitted

- Ensuring the app looks and works great across different screen sizes

- Deploying the app online so anyone can access and enjoy it

Instead of showing a final score, the app gives instant visual feedback: correct answers turn green, incorrect ones turn red, and the correct answer is clearly displayed below each question.
